# 🏠 House Price Prediction
Kaggle Project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lokeshhate/house-price-prediction-2-0

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting residential house prices using regression-based
Machine Learning models. The objective is to analyze how different housing features
influence property prices and to build models that accurately estimate house values.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end regression workflow including data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
